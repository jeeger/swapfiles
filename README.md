# swap â€“ Swap two files atomically

There's no shell utility for swapping two files or folders on Linux, even though it's possible with
the `renameat2()` syscall. This is a simple utility that uses the syscall to (almost) atomically
swap two files.

Currently, functionality is intentionally limited, but it should be a simple matter to extend the
program with more functionality.

## Installation

`autoreconf -i && ./configure && make && make install` should put the command into your path as
`swap`.

## Use

Call with `swap file1 file2`. That's it.
